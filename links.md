How to store page table entries on a storage medium, such as a disk. And dealing with page faults, which occur when needed pages are not in memory. 

* [Process creation and termination - fork(), exec(), wait() and exit()](https://youtu.be/TMNGAxtZzvw?si=3s-VuKdmogRaEcHz)--- In UNIX systems, process creation is accomplished using the fork() command, resulting in the creation of a parent process and a child process. The child process is an identical duplicate of the parent, and they both run concurrently. To execute different programs simultaneously, exec() overlays the code in a process. The parent process can suspend itself using wait() to await the child's completion. If wait() is not called by the parent, it continues running independently, leading to the creation of zombie processes if the child exits without being waited for. Alternatively, if the parent process terminates without waiting, any remaining child processes become orphans.

* [Deadlock in Operating System GeeksforGeeks](https://youtu.be/onkWXaXAgbY?si=Rws2ShTDZXGH1ZsQ)--- This video explains the definition of deadlock and what condition necessary for deadlock.
